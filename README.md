Health And Activity Monitor

The Health & Activity Monitor (H.A.M.) is an innovative solution for monitoring employees general physical well being, activities, and location. 
It's mostly designed as a monitoring system for personnel and can also be deployed in the military to collect battlefield data from soldiers 
(the addition of a body cam may be fitted to augment the system for its intended purpose.). It can be synced with smart phone or 
it can also be remotely monitored using a main server /control room setting.

Health & Activity Monitor (H.A.M.) is capable of reading a human's vital signs (pulse rate, body-temperature), 
the person’s gyroscopic orientation using a simple system of ball switches (handy if you want to know if your employee is lying down and
taking a nap or has fallen down.), the person’s general location using a GPS module, an accelerometer module to movements of the person.
All the data are collected are saved in an SD card and also are accessible through the use of WIFI.

The project isn't only limited for tracking individuals. The project can still be developed to meet medical standards.
Once it does, hospitals can use the project to monitor their outpatients. Patients who are at risk of unpredictable health conditions such us
having Seizures, Stroke, Cardiac Arrest and Heart Attack. If an incident does occur, the system can predict it before it even occurs,
the system would be able to notify the nearest hospital by sending the exact GPS coordinates of the person in need.
