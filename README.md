The Health & Activity Monitor (H.A.M.) is an innovative solution for monitoring employees general physical well being, activities, and location. 
It's mostly designed as a monitoring system for personnel and can also be deployed in the military to collect battlefield data from soldiers 
(the addition of a body cam may be fitted to augment the system for its intended purpose.). It can be synced with smart phone or it can also be 
remotely monitored using a internet-based database which can be accessible from any part of the world. Health & Activity Monitor (H.A.M.) 
is capable of reading a human's vital signs (pulse rate, body temperature), All the data are collected are accessible through the use of WIFI.

The project isn't only limited for tracking individuals. The project can still be developed further to meet medical standards. Once it does, 
hospitals can use the project to monitor their outpatients. Patients who are at risk of unpredictable health conditions such us having Seizures, 
Stroke, Cardiac Arrest and Heart Attack. If an incident does occur, the system can predict it before it even occurs, the system would be able to 
notify the nearest hospital by sending the exact GPS coordinates of the person in need.
